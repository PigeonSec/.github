## Grrrrruuuuuuhh!!! - PigeonSec

**Funded by breadcrumbs, powered by avian technology, and run by wacky birds.**  
We build **badass cybersecurity tools** that peck at phishing, malware, and shady domains until nothing malicious is left standing.  

🪶 **Website:** [pigeonsec.com](https://pigeonsec.com)  
🧠 **Mission:** Make the internet a little safer (and a lot funnier) — one domain at a time.  
🥖 **Funding:** 100% organic breadcrumbs and community crumbs.

### 🧰 What We Do
We’re not your average flock.  
We reverse-engineer, analyze, and automate the dirty jobs in cybersecurity — then publish tools like:
- 🕵️ **Magpie** – Blocklist aggregator that eats garbage data and spits out clean domains.
- 🪺 **Canary** – Phishing detection through certificate transparency.
- 🦉 **Owl** – Domain typo generator for lookalike detection.
- 🐦 …and other questionable avian experiments.
